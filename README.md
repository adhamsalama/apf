# APF

APF (Another Python Framework) is a minimalistic, unopinionated web framework for Python, inspired by FastAPI.

This is a hobby project made for educational purposes because I want to try learning writing a web server framework.

So, this is obviously not meant for production environments.

TODOS:

  - [ ] Add dynamic routing
  - [ ] Allow view functions to return dicts and pydantic classes and auto-serialize them
  - [ ] Make response methods not available from the request object to separate requests and responses completely.
