# APF

APF (Another Python Framework) is a minimalistic, unopinionated web framework for Python, inspired by FastAPI.

This is a hobby project made for educational purposes because I want to try learning writing a web server framework.

So, this is obviously not meant for production environments.

Development of SimpleAPI can be tracked at [this](https://github.com/users/adhamsalama/projects/1) GitHub project.
